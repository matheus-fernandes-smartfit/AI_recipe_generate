# whatwg-url-minimum

`whatwg-url-minimum` is a non-unicode implementation of the [WHATWG URL standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/) (derivative of [whatwg-url](https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/))

## Implementation

The goal of `whatwg-url-minimum` is to be a derivative of [whatwg-url](https://github.com/jsdom/whatwg-url/) that has been converted to be more compact and drops punycode/unicode support.
Its parser implementation is otherwise a mostly identical implementation ported to TypeScript.
